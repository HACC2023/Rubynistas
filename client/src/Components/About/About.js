          Zero Waste is building a healthier future, with a balanced consumer culture

          <p className="p1">
            This program started as an idea tossed around between friends after
            being inspired by other programs like this around the world. In
            October 2020, Zero Waste Oʻahu was awarded the NOAA Marine Debris
            Prevention Grant—which enabled this idea to come to life! We look
            forward to working in collaboration with restaurants, customers, and
            other community partners in developing waste-free takeout for Oʻahu.

                Single-use takeout containers and food wrappers account for up
                to one-third of the debris found on Hawai’i’s shorelines!!
                Offering a reusable takeout container system helps to address
                this issue (and many others) while also cultivating circular and
                zero waste economies.

                We’ve worked closely with community partners to design a
                waste-free takeout model that fits our local needs. We are
                excited to offer a program that will reduce costs for local
                restaurants by creating less rubbish to dispose of (yep, that
                costs $) and minimizing the amount of single-use items our
                restaurants have to purchase.{" "}
